Form Submission with E-Signature and Image Upload
This project is a web application that allows users to submit a form with their name, email, image upload, comment, and an e-signature. The form data is processed on the server, which generates a PDF document containing the form information, image, and signature.

Features
Form Submission: Users can input their name, email, comment, and upload an image.
E-Signature: Users can sign using a canvas, which is captured as a Base64 image and included in the form submission.
PDF Generation: The server generates a PDF containing the form data, uploaded image, and e-signature.
File Upload: Users can upload an image file, which is included in the generated PDF.


Tech Stack
Frontend:
HTML5 for the form and canvas for e-signature.
JavaScript for handling form submission and e-signature.
Backend:
Node.js with Express.js for handling requests.
multer for handling file uploads.
pdfkit for generating PDFs.

cd form-submission-signature
Install dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create necessary directories:

Create the necessary directories for file uploads and PDF generation:

bash
Copy code
mkdir uploads generated
Run the server:

Start the Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Access the Form: Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will see a form where you can input your name, email, upload a picture, add comments, and provide an e-signature.

The server will respond with a message and provide the path to the generated PDF.
The PDF will be saved in the /generated folder.
Key Files
index.html: Contains the form with fields for name, email, image upload, comment, and the signature canvas.
script.js: Handles the form submission, canvas drawing for the signature, and sending the form data to the server.
app.js: Node.js backend that handles file uploads, form data processing, and PDF generation using pdfkit.
Development
To modify or extend the project, follow these steps:

Frontend (Client-Side):

Modify the index.html file to update the form structure.
Add more functionality to script.js for handling form submission or canvas customization.
Backend (Server-Side):

Modify app.js to handle additional form fields, perform validation, or change the PDF generation logic.
